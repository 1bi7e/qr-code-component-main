## My process

For this component I needed only HTML and CSS. I started from building the index.html file by adding all the elements to the site and after that i made a styling with CSS. Styling began with mobile version then i added only max-width to make it responsive for bigger screens.


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS variables


### What I learned

Thanks to this project i had to learn how exactly Flexbox is working and how to place items on the webstie with it. I also dived more into the differences between using diffrent units for spacing like pixels or REM.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide from CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is easy to understand guide for basic Flexbox.
